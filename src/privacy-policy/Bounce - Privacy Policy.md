## Transferring your personal data outside of Europe

To enable the services offered to you through Bounce’s website and bot, the personal data which you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside the European Union (“EU”).

In addition, as highlighted above our service relies on Facebook and Chatfuel who may store your personal data outside the EU. In addition, if you use our services while you are outside the EU, your persona data may be transferred outside the EU in order for us to provide you with those services.

## Security precautions in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal data

When you give us personal data, we take steps to ensure that it’s treated securely. Any personal data and sensitive personal data (such as mental health metrics and payment details) are encrypted in transit and at rest on servers controlled by Bounce Technologies Limited. When you are on a secure page, a lock icon will appear in web browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

Once we receive your personal data, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. All personal data and sensitive personal data is stored on Amazon Web Services in dedicated, access controlled databases. The production version of the bot uses databases that are encrypted at rest to make sure your personal data is secure.

Finally, will to minimise the amount of personal data (including sensitive personal data) we store and collect from you by implementing privacy by design techniques into our design and development processes.

## Advice to protect your personal data on your own phone

When using our Messenger bot service, your personal data and sensitive personal data will be stored by Facebook in the Messenger app. We strongly advise that all users of our Messenger bot service use a passcode, fingerprint or facial recognition login service; encrypt their devices; only install official, certified apps; and enable “Find My Phone” or similar features to enable deletion of personal data if the device is stolen or lost. These features help you protect your personal data on your devices.

## What happens if you fail to provide us with personal data

If you do not provide the required personal data we will not be able to provide you with the services you have requested. 

In addition, we will be unable to provide you our Messenger bot service if you do not agree to the use of the Facebook Messenger and Chatfuel services.
